Help me draft a professional message. I'll describe what I need after this command.

When drafting, follow these guidelines:
1. **Match the tone** to the context — casual for team chat, formal for stakeholder updates, warm for recognition
2. **Be concise** — respect the reader's time, aim for clarity over completeness
3. **Structure for scanning** — use short paragraphs, bullets, or numbered lists when the content has multiple points
4. **Include a clear call-to-action** if the message requires a response or action
5. **Avoid jargon** unless the audience expects it

Provide the draft and a brief note on why you structured it that way. Offer to adjust tone, length, or focus.
