Help me evaluate a decision by analyzing the pros and cons. I'll describe the options after this command.

For each option, provide:

**Pros**
- List clear advantages (3–5 each)
- Note which pros have the highest impact

**Cons**
- List clear disadvantages or risks (3–5 each)
- Note which cons are dealbreakers vs. manageable

**Key Trade-offs**
- What are you giving up with each option?
- Are there any hidden costs or second-order effects?

**Recommendation**
- Based on the analysis, which option seems stronger and why?
- What additional information would make this decision easier?

Be balanced and honest. Don't default to "it depends" — take a position and explain your reasoning.
