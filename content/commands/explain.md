Explain the topic I mention after this command in simple, clear terms that anyone on the team can understand.

Follow this structure:

**In One Sentence**
- A plain-language summary a non-expert would get immediately

**How It Works**
- Break down the concept into 3–5 key parts using everyday analogies where helpful
- Avoid jargon; if you must use a technical term, define it inline

**Why It Matters**
- Explain why this is relevant to our work or the current discussion

**Learn More**
- Suggest 1–2 specific follow-up questions that would deepen understanding

Aim for clarity over completeness. It's better to be understood than to be thorough.
