## Common Questions New Members Ask
- "Where do I find [X]?" → Check pinned messages and channel bookmarks first
- "Who owns [Y]?" → Ask in the relevant project channel or check the team directory
- "Is this the right channel?" → When in doubt, ask in #general — someone will redirect you
- "How do I request access to [Z]?" → Usually your manager or IT channel
- "When should I DM vs. post in channel?" → Default to channel (transparency); DM for personal/sensitive topics
