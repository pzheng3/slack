Based on the conversation above, generate thoughtful follow-up questions that would move the discussion forward.

Provide questions in three categories:

**Clarifying Questions** (fill gaps)
- What's unclear or assumed? What details are missing?
- 2–3 questions that would sharpen the team's understanding

**Challenging Questions** (stress-test ideas)
- What assumptions haven't been examined?
- 2–3 questions that pressure-test the current direction

**Forward-Looking Questions** (drive action)
- What's the next decision that needs to be made?
- 2–3 questions that would help the team move to the next step

For each question, add a one-line note on *why* it matters. Prioritize questions that would unblock progress.
