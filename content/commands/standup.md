Help me write a concise standup update. I'll describe what I've been working on after this command.

Format my update as:

**Yesterday**
- What I completed or made progress on (2–3 bullets)

**Today**
- What I'm planning to focus on (2–3 bullets)

**Blockers**
- Anything slowing me down or needing help (or "None" if clear)

Rules:
- Keep each bullet to one line
- Use specific, observable outcomes (not vague "worked on X")
- If I mention a blocker, suggest who might be able to help or a way to unblock
- Keep the whole update under 100 words
