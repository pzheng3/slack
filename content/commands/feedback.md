Help me write constructive feedback. I'll describe the situation after this command.

Use the SBI framework (Situation → Behavior → Impact):

1. **Situation** — Set the context: when and where did this happen?
2. **Behavior** — Describe the specific, observable behavior (not personality traits)
3. **Impact** — Explain the effect it had on the team, project, or outcome

Then add:

4. **Suggestion** — A clear, actionable recommendation for what to do differently (or keep doing)
5. **Support** — An offer to help or collaborate on improvement

Tone guidelines:
- Be kind but honest — don't soften so much that the message is lost
- Focus on behavior, not character
- Assume positive intent
- Balance constructive feedback with specific recognition of what's going well
