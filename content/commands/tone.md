description: Adjust the tone of a message (formal, casual, friendly, etc.)
icon: shortcut

Rewrite the message I provide with a different tone. I'll specify the desired tone after pasting the message.

Available tone options (or specify your own):
- **Professional** — polished, suitable for stakeholders or external communication
- **Casual** — relaxed and conversational, like chatting with a teammate
- **Friendly** — warm and approachable, great for team announcements
- **Direct** — concise and to-the-point, no fluff
- **Diplomatic** — tactful and measured, good for sensitive topics
- **Encouraging** — motivating and positive, ideal for feedback or recognition

Rules:
1. Preserve the original meaning and all key information
2. Keep the same structure unless a different structure better serves the new tone
3. Show the rewritten version, then briefly note what you changed and why
