# Facilitation Tips

## Managing Time
- Set a timer for each agenda item; give a 2-minute warning
- If a topic runs over, ask: "Should we extend (and cut something else) or take this offline?"
- Protect the last 5 minutes for action item review

## Handling Dominant Speakers
- "Thanks [Name], let's hear from others. [Quiet person], what's your take?"
- Use round-robin for critical decisions
- In remote meetings, use chat for parallel input

## Keeping Focus
- When discussion drifts: "Great point — I'm adding that to the parking lot. Back to [current topic]..."
- Post the agenda visibly; refer back when needed
- If no agenda exists, spend the first 2 minutes creating one together

## Ensuring Decisions Stick
- Restate the decision aloud: "So we've decided [X]. [Name] owns this by [date]. Correct?"
- Send the summary within 1 hour of the meeting ending
- Schedule a follow-up check for open action items

## Retrospective Formats

### Start / Stop / Continue
- **Start**: What should we begin doing?
- **Stop**: What should we stop doing?
- **Continue**: What's working well?

### 4Ls (Liked / Learned / Lacked / Longed For)
Quick emotional check that surfaces both positives and gaps.

### Mad / Sad / Glad
Lower-pressure format for teams new to retros.
