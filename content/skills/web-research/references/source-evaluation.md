# Source Evaluation Guide

## Source Reliability Tiers

| Tier | Source Type | Trust Level | Examples |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **1 (Highest)** | Primary / Official | High | Official docs, original research, SEC filings, direct announcements |
| **2** | Reputable journalism | Medium-High | Major outlets, peer-reviewed journals, established trade publications |
| **3** | Expert analysis | Medium | Industry blogs by known experts, conference talks, analyst reports |
| **4** | Community | Low-Medium | Stack Overflow, Reddit, forums — useful but verify |
| **5 (Lowest)** | Unverified | Low | Anonymous posts, content farms, AI-generated aggregators |

## CRAAP Test for Source Evaluation

- **Currency** — When was it published? Is it still relevant?
- **Relevance** — Does it address the actual question?
- **Authority** — Who wrote it? What are their credentials?
- **Accuracy** — Is it supported by evidence? Can claims be verified?
- **Purpose** — Is it informational, persuasive, or commercial?

## Cross-Referencing Rules

1. **Single source** — Flag as "one source reports" and note reliability tier
2. **Two agreeing sources** — Present with moderate confidence
3. **Three+ agreeing sources** — Present as established fact (if sources are independent)
4. **Conflicting sources** — Present both sides, explain the discrepancy if possible

## Red Flags

- No author or publication date
- Claims without evidence or citations
- Highly emotional or clickbait language
- Site exists primarily to sell a product
- Information that only appears on one site
- Circular sourcing (multiple articles citing each other)

## When to Caveat

Always add caveats when:
- Information is < 24 hours old (still developing)
- Only one source available
- Source is tier 3 or below
- Topic involves rapidly changing data (prices, stock, live events)
- You're extrapolating beyond what sources explicitly state
