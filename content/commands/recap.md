I just joined this conversation and need to catch up fast. Give me a quick recap:

1. **What's being discussed?** — One sentence on the main topic
2. **What happened so far?** — A brief timeline of the key moments (3–5 bullets max)
3. **Where are we now?** — The current state: what's been decided, what's being debated, what's blocked
4. **What do I need to know?** — Any context or background that's critical to participate

Keep it under 150 words. Write it like a teammate quickly filling me in, not like a formal report.
