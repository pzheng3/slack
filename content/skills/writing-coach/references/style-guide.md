# Workplace Writing Style Guide

## Tone Spectrum

| Tone | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Formal** | C-suite comms, legal, external partners | "We are pleased to inform you..." |
| **Professional** | Cross-team updates, documentation | "Here's a summary of our Q1 progress." |
| **Conversational** | Team channels, 1:1 messages | "Quick heads up — we're changing..." |
| **Casual** | Close teammates, social channels | "Hey! Just pushed the fix 🎉" |

**Default to professional-conversational.** Err on the side of warmth over formality.

## Common Workplace Writing Fixes

### Before → After

**Hedging too much:**
- ❌ "I was just wondering if maybe we could possibly consider..."
- ✅ "Can we consider..."

**Burying the ask:**
- ❌ "So we had this meeting last week and discussed a bunch of things and one of the topics was the budget and I wanted to ask if you could approve the extra $5K."
- ✅ "Can you approve the extra $5K for [project]? Background: we discussed this in last week's meeting and the team agreed it's needed for [reason]."

**Passive voice:**
- ❌ "The deployment was completed by the team."
- ✅ "The team completed the deployment."

**Vague status updates:**
- ❌ "Working on the project. Making progress."
- ✅ "Shipped the auth module. Starting API integration tomorrow, on track for Friday demo."

## Email / Message Structure

### The BLUF Pattern (Bottom Line Up Front)
1. **Bottom line** — What you need or what happened (first sentence)
2. **Background** — Context the reader needs
3. **Details** — Supporting information
4. **Action** — What happens next and by when

### The SCR Pattern (Situation-Complication-Resolution)
1. **Situation** — What's the current state?
2. **Complication** — What's the problem or change?
3. **Resolution** — What do you propose?

## Feedback Writing Formula

```
"When [specific situation], [what happened/impact]. 
Going forward, [suggestion/alternative]."
```

**Example:**
"When we changed the API without updating the docs (last Tuesday's deploy), three customers filed support tickets. Going forward, let's add a docs-update checkbox to the deploy checklist."

## Words to Avoid in Professional Writing

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "Just" (minimizer) | Remove it or be direct |
| "Obviously" / "Clearly" | Remove — if it were obvious, you wouldn't need to say it |
| "ASAP" | Give a specific deadline |
| "Per my last email" | "As mentioned in [link]" or just restate |
| "Going forward" (overused) | "From now on" / "Starting [date]" / just remove |
| "Synergy" / "Leverage" | Use plain English |
