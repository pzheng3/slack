Help me brainstorm. I'll describe the topic or challenge after this command.

Follow this brainstorming framework:

**Rapid Ideas** (quantity over quality)
- Generate 8–10 diverse ideas quickly, ranging from safe/practical to bold/unconventional
- Don't self-censor — include wild ideas that push boundaries

**Top 3 Deep Dives**
- Pick the 3 most promising ideas and expand each with:
  - Why it could work
  - Biggest risk or challenge
  - A concrete first step to explore it

**Unexpected Angle**
- Offer one idea from a completely different perspective (different industry, inverted assumption, or contrarian take)

Keep the energy high and creative. Encourage me to build on ideas rather than dismiss them.
